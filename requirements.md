# Project Requirements

This document captures the high-level requirements for refactoring and enhancing the Platinum Employee Portal.

## 1. Core Functionality Preservation
- Retain existing modules and business workflows:
  - Job Purchase Orders (request/view)
  - Subcontract Requests (request/view)
  - Overhead Purchase Orders (request/view)
  - Safety certifications access
  - Payroll document access (handbook, contact list)

## 2. User Interface & UX Improvements
- Adopt a modern, responsive design (mobile-friendly).
- Implement a consistent theme and layout across all pages.
- Replace custom CSS with a framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).
- Utilize iconography (e.g., Font Awesome) for visual cues.

## 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee, Read-Only).
- Map permissions per role for each module and page:
  - CRUD permissions on vendor, job/phase/category, GL codes, subcontractors, etc.
  - View-only permissions for selected roles.
  - Administrative access for user and role management.

## 4. Enhanced Data Tables
- Replace static HTML tables with searchable, sortable, paginated tables.
  - Use DataTables.js or equivalent grid component.
- Add filters (date range, job number, vendor name, etc.)
- Support server-side pagination for large datasets.

## 5. Full CRUD Interfaces
- Provide Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for all business entities:
  - Vendors, Employees, Job/Phase/Category definitions, GL codes, Subcontractors.
  - Purchase Orders (job & overhead), Subcontracts.
- Enforce permissions at the controller/service layer.

## 6. Authentication & User Management
- Implement secure login/logout functionality.
- Password hashing, session management, CSRF protection.
- Provide an interface for Admins to manage users and assign roles.

## 7. Technology & Framework Recommendations
- **Backend:** Consider a PHP framework (Laravel, Symfony) or microframework (Slim).
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, React, or Stimulus for interactive components.
- **Styling:** Bootstrap 5 or Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development.
- **Tables:** jQuery DataTables or agâ€‘Grid for advanced table features.

## 8. Data Migration & Backwards Compatibility
- Plan database migrations for new tables (`users`, `roles`, `permissions`).
- Create seeders/migrations to preserve existing data.

## 9. Security & Compliance
- Input validation and sanitization.
- Protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
- Audit logging of CRUD actions by users.

## 10. Deliverables
- Updated project requirements and architecture plan.
- Wireframes or mockups of key pages.
- Proof-of-concept for RBAC and table component.
- Deployment documentation and upgrade guide.
